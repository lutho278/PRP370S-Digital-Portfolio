### Reflection: Career Counselling

**S ‚Äì Situation**  
As part of the Work Readiness Training for PRP370S, I engaged in career counselling activities designed to help me clarify my long-term career goals, evaluate my strengths and values, and begin forming a focused career development plan.

**T ‚Äì Task**  
My goal was to reflect deeply on my interests, skills, and future aspirations in order to define a realistic career direction and set actionable goals aligned with my personal values and strengths. I needed to make informed decisions about where I wanted to be in 1‚Äì3 years and how to get there.

**A ‚Äì Action**  
I completed various self-assessments, including goal-setting activities that encouraged me to ask: ‚ÄúWhat do I want to do in three years?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat does success look like at the highest level?‚Äù I used the SMART framework (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound) to turn broad aspirations into practical steps. I also identified skill gaps and outlined actions like learning from structured courses and gaining hands-on experience. These reflections were guided by prompts and best practices shared during the career counselling section.

**R ‚Äì Result**  
This process helped me define a clearer career vision and create a development plan that includes both short- and long-term goals. I now understand the importance of aligning my career path with my strengths and values, and I feel more confident in the steps I need to take, such as improving communication and technical leadership skills. Career counselling gave me a structured way to navigate my future and the motivation to act on it.
