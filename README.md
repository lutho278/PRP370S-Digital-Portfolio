### Reflection: Career Counselling

**S – Situation**  
As part of the Work Readiness Training for PRP370S, I engaged in career counselling activities designed to help me clarify my long-term career goals, evaluate my strengths and values, and begin forming a focused career development plan.

**T – Task**  
My goal was to reflect deeply on my interests, skills, and future aspirations in order to define a realistic career direction and set actionable goals aligned with my personal values and strengths. I needed to make informed decisions about where I wanted to be in 1–3 years and how to get there.

**A – Action**  
I completed various self-assessments, including goal-setting activities that encouraged me to ask: “What do I want to do in three years?” and “What does success look like at the highest level?” I used the SMART framework (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound) to turn broad aspirations into practical steps. I also identified skill gaps and outlined actions like learning from structured courses and gaining hands-on experience. These reflections were guided by prompts and best practices shared during the career counselling section.

**R – Result**  
This process helped me define a clearer career vision and create a development plan that includes both short- and long-term goals. I now understand the importance of aligning my career path with my strengths and values, and I feel more confident in the steps I need to take, such as improving communication and technical leadership skills. Career counselling gave me a structured way to navigate my future and the motivation to act on it.

### Reflection: Creating My CV

**S – Situation**  
As part of the Work Readiness Training for PRP370S, I was required to create a professional CV to showcase my academic background, technical skills, and project experience.

**T – Task**  
My task was to develop a CV that would represent my growth, competencies, and readiness for the ICT industry. It needed to be clear, structured, and tailored to highlight my strengths as a developer and designer.

**A – Action**  
I started by reviewing previous projects, particularly the GoSellin Gourmet PHP group project, where I contributed to both front-end and back-end development. I identified key technical tools and soft skills I had developed, including PHP, HTML, CSS, React, and collaboration. I formatted the CV using a clean structure and later converted it to Markdown to meet the digital portfolio requirements.

**R – Result**  
The result was a professional CV that clearly communicates my technical skills and project experience. It effectively highlights my contributions to real-world work and demonstrates my ability to adapt and collaborate. Through this process, I also improved my ability to present myself in a clear and marketable way.
